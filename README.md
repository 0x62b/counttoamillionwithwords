# counttoamillionwithwords
This is a Slack bot that moderates a channel, where you count to a million with words (eg. "six thousand seven hundred and forty one")

Commands:
/set-number [number] — overrides the counting number (only usable by me)
/countleaderboard — displays the leaderboard of counting

there are a lot lot lot lot lot of commits on this repo because i had to push to prod to test :sob:
